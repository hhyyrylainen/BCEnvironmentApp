  Hyyryl√§inen for the persuasive system design course.
</p>

<p>
  The goal of this web app is to provide you with easy to do daily
  tasks that have an impact on the environment.
</p>

<p>

  logins. User login statistics and other data is collected in order
  to show how many other users there are on the site and how well they
  are doing in the leaderboards.

<p>Welcome <%= link_to(current_user.email, profile_path) %>
  <%= 'you are an admin' if current_user.admin? %>
  <%= pluralize(@daily_users, 'user')%> have logged in today.
  <% if current_user.last_sign_in_at %>
  You last logged in at <%= localize(current_user.last_sign_in_at, :format => :long) %>
  <% end %>

  This is your home view where you can see your daily tasks and
  progress. You can view your badges in the badges view and compare
  your points against others on the leaderboards.
