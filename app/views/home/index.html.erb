<p>Welcome to Behaviour Change Environment App made by Henri
  Hyyryl√§inen for the persuasive system design course.
</p>

<p>
  The goal of this web app is to provide you with easy to do daily
  tasks that have an impact on the environment.
</p>

<p>
  You might want to <%= link_to('login', new_user_session_path) %> or
  perhaps <%= link_to('register', new_user_registration_path) %>.

<p>
  This app's code is on <a href="https://github.com/hhyyrylainen/BCEnvironmentApp">Github</a>
  (once the course is over. The repository is currently private)
</p>

<p>This site uses cookies for keeping track of browsing sessions and
  logins. User login statistics and other data is collected in order
  to show how many other users there are on the site and how well they
  are doing in the leaderboards.
